This project analyzes hotel booking data from 2015â€“2017 to understand cancellation patterns, customer behavior, and revenue impact. The goal is to identify the main reasons behind cancellations and suggest strategies that hotels can use to improve revenue and reduce booking cancellations.

Business Problem

Hotels often face high cancellation rates, especially from city hotels and online travel agencies. 
This leads to:

Loss of revenue.
Empty rooms that could have been sold.
Poor forecasting of demand.

 Key Questions

What factors influence hotel booking cancellations?
Which hotel type (City or Resort) faces more cancellations?
Are cancellations higher during specific months or seasons?
Does pricing (Average Daily Rate) affect cancellations?
Which customer segments and countries cancel the most?

ðŸ“Š Hypotheses

Higher prices (ADR) lead to more cancellations.
Customers booking far in advance (long lead times) cancel more often.
Online Travel Agencies have higher cancellation rates compared to direct bookings.
Summer months (peak season) experience more cancellations.
